Exploring text-based tools when I can (on night shift, and outta sync):
SimpleNote
jEdit (multiple platforms)
TaskWarrior (multiple platforms) and Vit and pTask on Ubuntu

Want to convert the physical Win10 install on my Toshiba laptop to a virtual machine:
a.) Tools?
b.) Best storage medium for VM? 128GB/USB3.0 flash drive? External hard disk?
c.) Will I need to reactivate win10?
