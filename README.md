things i learned today

**This is a project to:**

1. Help me learn how to use git and the tools that work with it
2. Record unique things I learn, so I don't have to reinvent the wheel when I need that information later
3. Record information (usually resources) I want to bookmark for tech projects later
4. Learn a little Markdown in the process...
