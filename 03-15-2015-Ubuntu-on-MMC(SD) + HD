XP-era laptops (Dell Latitude X1 and IBM ThinkPad X41) basic Xubuntu installation scheme:

/boot | 1GB | ext2; on laptop internal hard drive
Remaining space on laptop internal HD as NTFS data storage (could also use for /home)

swapspace | 2GB | swap; on MMC/SD card  (these are 1GB and 1.25GB RAM systems)
/ | ext4+journaled | 62GB; remaining space on MMC/SD card as root (I used 64GB SD cards)

Make sure the install is pointed to the internal HD for installing the bootloader.
I set vm.swappiness=5, installed Gnumeric and AbiWord
